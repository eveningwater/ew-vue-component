### 🌍 Smart Environment Detection Release

This version implements automatic environment switching mechanism consistent with Vue:

- Build outputs are divided into development/production sets (CJS/ESM/Global/Types)
- Entry files and exports field automatically switch between development/production builds based on `process.env.NODE_ENV`
- Developers don't need to worry about environment variables, just import/require the main package directly, and bundlers and Node will automatically select the optimal build

**Output Description:**
- CJS: `dist/ew-vue-component.cjs.js` (dev) / `dist/ew-vue-component.cjs.prod.js` (prod)
- ESM: `dist/ew-vue-component.esm.js` (dev) / `dist/ew-vue-component.esm.prod.js` (prod)
- Browser Global: `dist/ew-vue-component.global.js` / `dist/ew-vue-component.global.prod.js`
- Type Declarations: `dist/ew-vue-component.d.ts`

## [0.0.2-beta.5] - 2025-01-02

### Usage
```javascript
// Import style file
import 'ew-vue-component/dist/ew-vue-component.css';
```

- 📱 **Responsive Testing**: Styles perform well on different screen sizes

### 📋 Design Principles
- **Non-intrusive**: Styles only affect internal library elements
- **Overridable**: All styles can be customized through CSS overrides
- **Performance First**: CSS files are optimized for fast loading
- **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't affect existing project usage patterns
